        <h1>SUMMARY</h1>
		<p>
    Five high school students from different walks of life endure a Saturday detention under a power-hungry principal (Paul
    Gleason).The disparate group includes rebel John (Judd Nelson), princess Claire (Molly Ringwald), outcast Allison (Ally 
    Sheedy), brainy Brian (Anthony Michael Hall) and Andrew (Emilio Estevez), the jock. Each has a chance to tell his or her
    story, making the others see them a little differently -- and when the day ends, they question whether school will ever 
    be the same.

Dear Mr. Vernon, we accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole Saturday 
in detention for whatever it was we did wrong. But we think you’re crazy to make
us write an essay telling you who we think we are…
                 
Andrew Clark: ...and an athlete...

Allison Reynolds: ...and a basket case...
                 
Claire Standish: ...a princess...
                 
John Bender: ...and a criminal...
                 
Brian Johnson: Does that answer your question?... Sincerely yours, the Breakfast Club."
                </p>

John Bender: Who cares?

Allison Reynolds: I do.</li></pre>
